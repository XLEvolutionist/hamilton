***Genetic Populations***

* **Panmixia** The notion that a population is a single colection of individauls where mating is random and movement of individuals is uniform $\longrightarrow$ this is rarely true for natural populations.

Several things can cuase devaition from *Panmixis*. Movement of individuals is often not random and the chance of two individuals mating often depends on their position in the population $\longrightarrow$ this is known as **Population Structure**. This harks back the the earlier chapter where Hamilton discusses **Isolation by distance**.

But what are the impacts of popultion structure on local allele and genetype frequencies?
